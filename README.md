**Online Pharmacy**

Online Pharmacy is a centralized platform designed for the selling and purchasing of medicines. The application supports two types of users:

Admin (Store Owner): The admin has full control over the inventory, allowing them to add, edit, and delete medicines.

Customer: Customers can browse available medicines with detailed descriptions and quantities.
They can add items to the cart, adjust the quantity of each item, or remove items entirely.
Once they proceed to checkout, they are directed to a payment page (currently only card payments are supported). 
Upon successful payment, the customer will receive an order confirmation message. Additionally, customers can access their order history to view past purchases.
There is also one more feature, filter by name where user can search the medicine by name.
